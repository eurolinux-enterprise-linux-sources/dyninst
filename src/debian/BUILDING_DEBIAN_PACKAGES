In order to build Debian packages the following steps need to be taken, from
a Debian machine:

1. Copy the Debian directory into core.
2. Make sure the scripts directory is in the same directory as core.
3. Install all of the Build-Depends packages listed in debian/control.
4. Make sure debian/rules is executable
5. Verify that libdyninst.install, libdyninst-dev.install, and dyninst-testsuite.install
   put the correct set of files in the correct place.
6. Run dpkg-buildpackage

Notes:
* tcl, tk, bison, and flex are dyner dependencies.  Remove if we remove dyner from the
  non-tar distributions.
